                        Thailand[a] (/ˈtaɪlænd, ˈtaɪlənd/ TY-land, TY-lənd), historically known as Siam[b][10][11]
                        (/saɪˈæm,
                        ˈsaɪæm/) and officially the Kingdom of Thailand, is a country in Southeast Asia, located at the
                        centre of Mainland Southeast Asia, spanning 513,120 square kilometres (198,120 sq mi), with a
                        population of almost 70 million.[5] The country is bordered to the north by Myanmar and Laos, to
                        the
                        east by Laos and Cambodia, to the south by the Gulf of Thailand and Malaysia, and to the west by
                        the
                        Andaman Sea and the extremity of Myanmar. Thailand also shares maritime borders with Vietnam to
                        the
                        southeast, and Indonesia and India to the southwest. Thailand has experienced multiple coups and
                        military dictatorships. Since 2019, it has been nominally a parliamentary constitutional
                        monarchy;
                        in practice, however, structural advantages in the constitution have ensured the military's hold
                        on
                        power.[12] Bangkok is the nation's capital and largest city.

                                We present the first openly available corpus for detecting depression in Thai. Our

                                compiled by expert verified cases of depression in several online blogs. We experiment
                                with two
                                different LSTM based models and two different BERT based models. We achieve a 77.53\%
                                accuracy with
                                a Thai BERT model in detecting depression. This establishes a good baseline for future

                    Apart from a brief period of parliamentary democracy in the mid-1970s, Thailand has periodically
                    alternated between democracy and military rule. Since the 2000s the country has been caught in
                    continual bitter political conflict between supporters and opponents of Thaksin Shinawatra, which
                    resulted in two coups (in 2006 and 2014), along with the establishment of its current constitution,
                    a nominally democratic government after the 2019 Thai general election, and ongoing pro-democracy
                    protests that began in 2020.

                    Thailand,[c] officially the Kingdom of Thailand,[d] was formerly known as the exonym Siam[e] by
                    outsiders prior to 1949. According to George Cœdès, the word Thai (ไทย) means 'free man' in the Thai
                    language, "differentiating the Thai from the natives encompassed in Thai society as
                    serfs".[17]: 197  According to Chit Phumisak, Thai (ไท) simply means 'people' or 'human being', his
                    investigation shows that some rural areas used the word "Thai" instead of the usual Thai word khon
                    (คน) for people.[18] According to Michel Ferlus, the ethnonyms Thai-Tai (or Thay-Tay) would have
                    evolved from the etymon *k(ə)ri: 'human being'.[f][20]

                    Thais often refer to their country using the polite form prathet Thai (Thai: ประเทศไทย), they also
                    use the more colloquial term mueang Thai (Thai: เมืองไทย) or simply Thai; the word mueang,
                    archaically referring to a city-state, is commonly used to refer to a city or town as the centre of
                    a region. Ratcha Anachak Thai (Thai: ราชอาณาจักรไทย) means 'kingdom of Thailand' or 'kingdom of
                    Thai'. Etymologically, its components are: ratcha (Sanskrit: राजन्, rājan, 'king, royal, realm');
                    -ana- (Pali āṇā 'authority, command, power', itself from the Sanskrit आज्ञा, ājñā, of the same
                    meaning) -chak (from Sanskrit चक्र cakra- 'wheel', a symbol of power and rule). The Thai National
                    Anthem (Thai: เพลงชาติ), written by Luang Saranupraphan during the patriotic 1930s, refers to the
                    Thai nation as prathet Thai (Thai: ประเทศไทย). The first line of the national anthem is: prathet
                    thai ruam lueat nuea chat chuea thai (Thai: ประเทศไทยรวมเลือดเนื้อชาติเชื้อไทย), 'Thailand is the
                    unity of Thai flesh and blood'.
